# Quran.az

Quran.az is an educational project offering easy access to the Quran in Azerbaijani and Russian translations. The website provides seamless navigation and search features to explore surahs, ayahs, and translations. It aims to be a reliable resource for anyone seeking to study or understand the Quran.

## Features

- **Simple Navigation**: Quickly access specific surahs or ayahs with intuitive URLs:
  - `https://quran.az/1` for the first surah.
  - `https://quran.az/96/1` for the first ayah of the 96th surah.
  - `https://quran.az/2/255` for Ayatul Kursi.
- **Comprehensive Search**: Find words or phrases in the Quran with a dedicated search interface:
  - `https://quran.az/search/[keyword]`
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for various devices to ensure accessibility.

### Guidelines for Effective Use

- **Search Recommendations**:
  - Pay attention to grammatical accuracy. For example, search for `Məkkə` instead of `mekke` for better results.
  - Consider synonyms or alternative translations, as the exact word you search might not appear in all translations.
- **Translation Notes**:
  - Differences in wording or interpretation may arise due to the diverse styles of translators.
